# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

## Description
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

### Example 1
**Input**: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8  
**Output**: 6  
**Explanation**: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

### Example 2
**Input**: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4  
**Output**: 2  
**Explanation**: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

### Example 3
**Input**: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1  
**Output**: 2  

### Constraints
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.  
-109 <= `Node.val` <= 109  
All `Node.val` are unique.  
`p` != `q`  
`p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

## Strategy
A binary tree is a tree where a node has a lower value of itself to the left, and a hgher value of itself to the right.

If `p` and `q` both have a lower value than the current node in the tree, it means that the LCA is down to the left, else viceversa. 

If the current node is where `p` and `q` split to the right and left or it is equal to either `p` or `q`, then the that current node is the LCA.

## Time Complexity - O(log n)
Not all n nodes are visited. When deciding to move to the right or left, we are potentially ignoring whole section of nodes to the right or left.

## Space Complexity - O(1)
No variables with n size are used.
